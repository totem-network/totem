        Current cloud storage solutions store the user data unencrypted
        on centralized server infrastructures where it often gets
        analyzed to build profiles of their customers. Even when data
        is encrypted at rest the private keys are kept on the same
        infrastructure as the data to decrypt it whenever a user
        sends a request. This opens a door for hackers since all data
        is in one place with their respective decryption keys as they
        gain access to the network.

        This paper takes a look at how a distributed architecture can
        solve the problems mentioned above and how to make it usable
        for the average user. Blockchain technology enables a
        decentralized identity system for permission management of
        stored files in the peer to peer cloud storage. Preparing
        files on the users device before encrypting them mitigates
        some issues of distributed systems.
