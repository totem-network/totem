\section{Problem statement}

While the key components of an end to end encrypted
distributed cloud storage exists, fitting them
together and make the solution work afor end users
with a good user experience is no trivial task.

One aspect of cryptographic systems is key management.
It is different from current authentication, since
the users are responsible for protecting their keys.
There is no method of account recovery when the keys
are lost.

The DID standard only describes how the documents
are structured, but the implementation of a
registry is not defined. The registry must be
on a distributed network aswell, to guarantee
access to the file permissions for every user.

To fulfill the needs of users to be as fast
as possible, decentralized networks fall short
in comparison to centralized solutions.

The last disadvantage of an end to end encrypted
cloud is that data cannot be used to drive
development in artificial intelligence forward.
