\section{Introduction}

Cloud Storage is expected to grow at a rapid pace over the next
decade while the amount of data generated increases. With more
digital infrastructure we store more sensitive information in
the cloud. A distributed end-to-end encrypted approach provides
users more security and the ability to own their data.
Such an ecosystem consists of multiple important parts with their
own problems to solve. An identity system for authentication,
a peer to peer file storage and a end user client for convenient
access to the data.

Decentralized identifiers stored on a public blockchain to ensure
data consistency with their public encryption keys allow every
participant to verify the integrity of the system. This also
enables access control for the files.

Data is stored on a peer to peer system with content addressable
hashes of files. To locate a file a peer has to query the
distributed hash table stored by network participants.

An end user client combines those systems for an easy to use
experience. It handles management of cryptographic keys,
caching of data and preperation of files before encryption to
save bandwidth and optimize performance.
