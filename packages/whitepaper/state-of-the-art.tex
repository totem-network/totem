Current cloud storage providers dont offer end to end encryption
for their users and store data on centralized servers. With this
approach data can be used for artificial intelligence to learn
from big datasets it comprises on privacy and security.

The W3C has developed a standard for decentralized identifiers
(DID). It can handle authentication with asymetric encryption
and provides public key discovery of users for sharing data.
\cite{did}

Ethereum is a distributed smart contract platform based on
blockchain technology that allows anyone to develop simple
decentralized programs. Those programs can be accessed by
everyone.

A working distributed storage network is IPFS. It lets users
store files that a referenced by a content hash. Everyone
can request files from the network by this hash.
